To update the documentation to reflect the improved Julia version management and ensure clarity for users on how to specify a Julia version using the `JULIA_VERSION` environment variable, here's a revised version of the text:

# heroku-buildpack-julia

This is a [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for [Julia](http://julialang.org) apps.

## Getting Started

This buildpack enables the deployment of Julia applications on Heroku. To get started, ensure your project contains a `Project.toml` and optionally a `Manifest.toml`. The buildpack installs all project dependencies at build time.

### Specifying Julia Version

You can specify the version of Julia to be used by your application in two ways:

1. **Using `Project.toml`**: Specify the Julia version in your `Project.toml` under `[compat]` as per [Julia's package compatibility documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/compatibility). This method is recommended for ensuring compatibility with your project's dependencies.

2. **Using Environment Variable**: For more direct control or to override the version specified in `Project.toml`, you can set the `JULIA_VERSION` environment variable on Heroku to the desired Julia version.

To set the Julia version using the environment variable:
```bash
heroku config:set JULIA_VERSION="1.10.2"
```

If `JULIA_VERSION` is not set, the buildpack will default to the latest supported Julia version at the time of the buildpack's release.

### Deploying Your App

To run your Julia server, you need to define a `Procfile` with the command to start your server. For example:
```plaintext
web: julia --project src/app.jl $PORT
```
This command is in line with our [example project](https://github.com/Optomatica/heroku-julia-sample) that utilizes Mux.jl.

Alternatively, for a server using HTTP.jl, your `Procfile` might look like:
```plaintext
web: julia --project -e 'using Foo; Foo.serve("0.0.0.0", $PORT)'
```
In this command, `Foo` represents the name of your project, and `serve` is a function that accepts `host` and `port::Int` to start an HTTP server.

### Important Note
Ensure your application binds to the provided `$PORT` quickly upon launch. Failure to do so may prevent Heroku from deploying your app successfully.
